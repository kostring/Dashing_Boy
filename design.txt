High level design
Game logic related classes:
1 Player : public Sprite
enum status{
	none,
	running,
	jumping,
	sliding,
	dashing,
	hitting,
	blinking,
	diying
}playerStatus;
	functions:
		functions to accept control(jump, slide, hit, use skill)
		functions to update status, include the action end callbacks, scheduled updates etc.(we need a state machine to handle the status change)
		functions to interact with the environment
2 Terrain and block
The most complex thing, we need to design the terrain by using an already-write-done-script, to decide put which block at which position.
enum {
	
}BlockTypes;
3 items

4 Monsters

5 Bullets

6 Boss
